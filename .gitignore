"Can you help me create a custom horizontal scrollbar for a scrolling container of offer boxes? I want the scrollbar to be styled to match the design of the offer boxes, and I would like it to be hidden by default but visible when the user hovers over the container. Additionally, I want the scrollbar to be wider than the default and have rounded corners. Please provide the necessary HTML and CSS code to achieve this.
